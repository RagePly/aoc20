Project repository for the 2020-edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)!

## Conclusion
Had a lot of fun this year, it was the first time I managed to get all 50 stars! The biggest challange by far was day 20 as it took a long time to complete. And because of that it is the challenge I enjoyed the most.

## Things learnt in python
This year had me try out the module *itertools* for the first time.

I also learnt about context managers using **with-as** statements, **list processing** and the data type **set**. 

## Timing
Based on a single trial, all challenges run consecutively takes 110.607 seconds to complete. The avarage time is 4.424 seconds. The quickest is day 13 with a 22ms execution time and the slowest is day 17 with a 31.284 second execution time.
